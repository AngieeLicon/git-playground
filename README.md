##  Introduction
Somtimes I like to play with the git commands but I don't really want to impact my day to day projects. That's how this playground was borned.

## What is this for?
This is a place where I can do commits, merges, git reset or rebase, and I don't have to worry about what could happen.

## The future
In future, the idea of this project is to hold my git tests, specially for complex git operations. 

* One thing I want to try now is cherry-picking

## Credits
This project is inspired in the cours git and git hub from Platzi.
