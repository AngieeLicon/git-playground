My notes

Let's start by wrinting something here with a number.

Add some more useful information here.

We have gone to the past, let's rewrite history here.

Playing around with git reset --soft.

Exp1 - From 'experiment' branch

Exp2 - Second experiment line

Main1 - This is for the rebase test

Main2 - A commit done after the changes to experiment branch

One more line to the history.
